                <p>Banks worldwide are divesting from coal. There is a right and a wrong way to manage towns built to mine coal and power the country. The wrong way means protracted unemployment, elevated rates of suicide, drug abuse and domestic violence. 
                </p>
                <p>After the Smoke Clears is a five part radio series examining how the La Trobe Valley ends its reliance of coal and transitions to renewables. Broadcast on Melbourne station 3CR, then promoted nationally through Beyond Zero Emissions and 3CR, we investigate how a community grapples with social and environmental fallout. A dedicated website will provide this community, audience and politicians with a forum to discuss the transition's pitfalls and opportunities. </p>
                <p>    
                    This project is timed to coincide with this year's Victorian election, to bridge the coal-rich mining towns with the vote-rich urban centres. It will provoke informed discussion and discover how the transition from coal can BEST be managed for everyone.

                    Coal is becoming economically unviable. The Big Four Banks have divested and, to comply with the Paris Agreement, renewable alternatives must be investigated. Yet such change can be socially and politically painful. Trump's America and Brexit's UK are a testament to this. Australia is not immune to the very same forces.
                </p>
                <p>When Hazelwood Power station shut down in 2017 the attached town of Morwell experienced soaring rates of unemployment, drug use, domestic violence and suicide. With the next state election this year the political fallout has yet to be felt. With recent closures in Liddell NSW and others to follow it is imperative that the strengths and weaknesses of the Valley are understood. The region is bouncing back - the community is resilient and innovative initiatives are being developed. If this case is understood, and politicians are held to account the best can be replicated while the worst is avoided.
