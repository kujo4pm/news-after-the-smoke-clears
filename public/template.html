          <h1>Why do this?</h1>
          <p>Banks worldwide are divesting from coal. There is a right and a wrong way to manage towns built to mine coal and power the country. The wrong way means protracted unemployment, elevated rates of suicide, drug abuse and domestic violence. This can lead to political instability in the long-term, ending with phenomena like Trump or Brexit. In Australia we are not immune to the same forces.</p>
          <p>After the Smoke Clears is a five part radio series examining how the La Trobe Valley ends its reliance of coal and transitions to renewables. Broadcast on Melbourne station 3CR, then promoted nationally through Beyond Zero Emissions and 3CR, we investigate how a community grapples with social, political and environmental fallout. A dedicated website will provide this community, audience and politicians with a forum to discuss the transition’s pitfalls and opportunities.</p>

                Trump's America and Brexit's UK are a testament to this.

          <p>This project is timed to coincide with this year’s Victorian election, to bridge the coal-rich mining towns with the vote-rich urban centres. It will provoke informed discussion and discover how the transition from coal can BEST be managed for everyone.</p>
          <p>By drawing attention to some of the pioneering renewable projects being pursued in ‘The Valley’, After the Smoke Clears will also draw investment from urban centres into pilot schemes like micro-grids, community energy hubs and solar startups, creating local jobs.</p>
