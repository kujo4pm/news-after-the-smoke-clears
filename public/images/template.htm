          <h1>...but why?</h1>
          <p>Banks worldwide are divesting from coal. There is a right and a wrong way to manage towns built to mine coal and power the country. The wrong way means protracted unemployment, elevated rates of suicide, drug abuse and domestic violence. This can lead to political instability in the long-term, ending with phenomena like Trump or Brexit. In Australia we are not immune to the same forces.</p>
          <p>After the Smoke Clears is a five part radio series examining how the La Trobe Valley ends its reliance of coal and transitions to renewables. Broadcast on Melbourne station 3CR, then promoted nationally through Beyond Zero Emissions and 3CR, we investigate how a community grapples with social, political and environmental fallout. A dedicated website will provide this community, audience and politicians with a forum to discuss the transition’s pitfalls and opportunities.</p>

                Trump's America and Brexit's UK are a testament to this.

          </aside>
          <p>This project is timed to coincide with this year’s Victorian election, to bridge the coal-rich mining towns with the vote-rich urban centres. It will provoke informed discussion and discover how the transition from coal can BEST be managed for everyone.</p>
          <p>By drawing attention to some of the pioneering renewable projects being pursued in ‘The Valley’, After the Smoke Clears will also draw investment from urban centres into pilot schemes like micro-grids, community energy hubs and solar startups, creating local jobs.</p>

          <h1>What seems to be the problem here?</h1>
          <p>After the closure of Hazelwood Power Station in March 2017 the adjacent town of Morwell achieved the highest level of unemployment in Victoria. Corresponding social issues like soaring rates of drug abuse, domestic violence and suicide in the Valley are also amongst the state’s highest. Businesses are leaving too. The main street is a parade of For Lease signs. </p>
          <p>Despite large investment from state government these issues continue. There is also a general feeling within the community that politicians have abandoned them, preferring to court city votes. People are angry.</p>
          <p>But this is a strong and resilient community that has pursued many innovative ideas to draw city dollars with limited success. It is time these ideas and these issues were investigated and explained, to provoke debate and discussion and hopefully stoke up some political will by politicians that have for too long overlooked the Valley.
          </p><p>Describe the potential legacy of the project beyond Bank of Melbourne Neighbourhood Fund support (150)</p>
          <p>The radio series will be played on existing program Beyond Zero </p>
